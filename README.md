# Graduation Thesis (Design)
 Backup for undergraduate thesis (design) of 2020 B.E.SE@SYSU.

## On progress

- Perusing relevant papers.
- Summarizing objective function and generator & discriminator architecture.
- Dataset preparation and pre-trained model.



## Attention

- unpaired image-to-image translation (CycleGAN)
- style transfer mapping with unsupervised learning 
- conditional batch normalization and its variations 
- ResNet blocks implementation in Keras
- attention mechanism to make robust to sketches



## Past Work

- [Reproduction of *Image Generation from Sketch Constraint Using Contextual GAN*](https://github.com/hansenbeast/2019-SYSU-DM/tree/master/Final_Project)
